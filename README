HOW TO RUN
1)  You'll need Gradle 5+ to do this.  Get scoop and use that to pull in Gradle, it's what I did!
2)  Run the DesktopLauncher.  Make sure the working directory selected is "<whatever>\LibgdxTurnBasedStrategy\core\assets",
which is NOT the Intellij default.
3)  You'll want to use the local Gradle distribution, which might be at somewhere similar to C:/Users/ironl/scoop/apps/gradle/5.1.1
(assuming you used Scoop to download it.)
